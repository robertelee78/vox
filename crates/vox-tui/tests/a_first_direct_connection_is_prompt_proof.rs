//! PRD-001 **R42, open** (RP-22) — **a first direct connection completes in under 2 s**, driven
//! through the shipped `vox` binary.
//!
//! **The claim.** Two people have met: the guest has joined the host's room, the host trusts the
//! guest, and nothing is running on the guest's side. The guest starts `vox up` and asks it for the
//! host's service (`ssh user@<room>.vox` does exactly this, over SOCKS5). The wait from that moment
//! until the pair is **on a direct path** — rung 1, a direct dial of an address the host advertises —
//! must be under 2 s, and so must the wait until the request is answered by any path at all.
//!
//! **The staging — real processes only.** A `vox node` anchor on `[::]` (dual-stack), a `vox serve`
//! host on `127.0.0.1`, and the guest on `[::1]`, set up with `vox id`, `vox trust add` and
//! `vox connect`. Split by address family, host and guest cannot send each other a datagram; the
//! host advertises a **port forward** the proof owns (`support/port_forward.rs`, via the proof-only
//! `VOX_TEST_ADVERTISE`), an `[::1]` socket that carries datagrams to and from the host with no
//! delay — the host is "publicly reachable at a forwarded port", the open topology. The forward is
//! therefore the pair's **only direct path** (the host's own address and the address the anchor
//! observes for it are IPv4, which the guest cannot reach), and so "direct" is **counted**: a
//! request whose echo payload crossed the forward rode the direct path; one whose payload did not
//! rode the anchor's circuit.
//!
//! **Cold, each sample.** Each sample starts a **new** `vox up` on a **new** port, so no connection
//! and no forward mapping carries over; the last one was stopped with Ctrl-C (by PID), so the host
//! was told it went away. The two production-Argon2id unlocks `vox up` does before it can take a
//! request are outside the clock, as a person waits for them at the prompt. The clock starts at the
//! earlier of the moment `vox up` says it is up and the first datagram of that `vox up` at the
//! forward — so a dial the node begins by itself, before anyone asks, is on the clock too.
//!
//! **What is asserted**, on every one of [`SAMPLES`] samples, against hard-coded numbers:
//! - the first request is answered (SOCKS reply 0 and a whole echo) in under 2000 ms;
//! - the pair is on the direct path (an echo whose bytes crossed the forward) in under 2000 ms;
//! - every sample reached the direct path at all ([`GIVE_UP`]), and the forward carried bytes.
//!
//! Printed: min / median / p95 / max of both, how many first answers came over the circuit, and
//! how many dials began before `vox up` said it was up.
//!
//! **The mutation that must turn it red:** delay the ladder's direct dial (not a circuit's) by
//! 2.5 s in `nat::reachability::connect_direct_within`. The first answer still comes fast, over the
//! anchor's circuit, and the direct path lands only after 2.5 s — red on the direct bound.
//!
//! Replaces `crates/vox-core/tests/perf_r42_first_connect_open_gate.rs`, which ran every node in
//! process on a NAT simulator.
