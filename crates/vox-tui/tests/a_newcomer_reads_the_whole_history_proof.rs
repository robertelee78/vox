//! V210-45 (#220), ADR-037 R1 (#958) — **a newcomer to a room with a backlog talks at the fresh
//! room's wait, and reads the history on demand**, driven through the **shipped `vox` binary**.
//!
//! **The claims.** Alice and bob trust each other before either daemon runs, so alice's consent to
//! bob predates every post she makes. A room keeps history forever by default, and consent is
//! forward-only from the moment it is decided (ADR-006), so bob, joining cold after alice has
//! posted, must read every one of her posts — not only the ones since her last key rotation, and
//! not only the newest page of anything. And his join must not cost him the room's present:
//!
//! 1. **One wait, fresh or behind** (ADR-037 R1, #958). From the moment bob's `vox room join`
//!    returns, alice reads bob's first post and bob reads the post alice makes after his join
//!    within [`READY_WITHIN`], whether the room was empty when he joined or carried [`BACKLOG`]
//!    posts he has yet to fetch. [`a_newcomer_talks_both_ways_at_one_wait_fresh_or_behind_a_backlog`]
//!    stages both rooms in one run and asserts the one constant for each. Before ADR-037 a
//!    joiner's first use waited on, or was refused for, the room's convergence ("joined and has
//!    not yet synced"); the fresh room never paid that, so the two waits differed.
//! 2. **The history is read on demand** (R1). A joiner's sparse join holds a live window of the
//!    newest `MAX_PAGE_ENTRIES` (128) rows of an author and leaves the backlog below it where it
//!    is. Bob pages back through the room in its order (`--json --limit --before`, as a person
//!    pages back) and, each time he reaches the oldest row he holds, asks for the page before it
//!    with `vox room read --history older --before <that row>`; each such page arrives within
//!    [`PAGE_WITHIN`], and in the end he reads every `post <i>` **once each and in order**, within
//!    [`BOUND`] of his join. Two sizes: [`BACKLOG`] (160: 32 below the window) **blocks**; 1,500
//!    (across the sender-key rotation at 1,000, ADR-006 `N`) is **optional** for its staging time.
//!
//! **The defect this began with.** Bob's paged read stopped at 500 posts, 1,001–1,500: a sender
//! key rotates every 1,000 messages, and a newcomer was handed only the generation current at its
//! admission, released at its origin. The rotated-out generation that sealed posts 1–1,000 was
//! never released to him, although the author retains its origin precisely so it can be.
//!
//! **What this drives, as an operator would type it:**
//!
//! ```text
//! vox id; vox trust add …          # alice and bob consent to each other, before any daemon
//! vox daemon                       # alice's node
//! vox room create; vox room post   # the backlog, each one a separate `vox room post`
//! vox daemon; vox room join        # bob, cold, from alice's `vox room link`
//! vox room post                    # alice once more, and bob's first word
//! vox room read                    # each reads the other: the wait, from the join's return
//! vox room read --json --limit --before     # bob pages back through what he holds
//! vox room read --history older --before    # and asks for the page below it
//! ```
//!
//! Alice's own paged read must show every post she made once each in order, or it is a `PRODUCT`
//! red: each was accepted. A read that fails is `PRODUCT`, never an empty page; a join the product
//! turns away is `PRODUCT` with its reason.
//!
//! **Every participant is the shipped binary.** Nothing in this process runs a node, opens a
//! store or speaks a wire protocol; each step is a `vox` process with its own
//! `VOX_DATA_DIR`/`VOX_CONFIG_DIR`, killed by its PID when dropped.
//!
//! **Ordering.** Whether a generation was minted after bob was trusted is decided by the
//! profile's logical consent order (one persisted counter every mint and every trust decision
//! draws from), never by a clock. The first fix compared whole seconds and went red 1 run in 2
//! here: alice's `trust add` and her `room create` fall in the same second often enough. This
//! staging leaves them back to back on purpose, and must be green every run.
//!
//! The negative half — nothing sealed before a decision is ever read, and a generation spanning
//! the decision is read from the decision on — is `a_member_reads_only_what_follows_trust_proof`.
//!
//! **Mutations, one per claim:**
//! - a first-use refusal or wait on the room's convergence put back (a text post refused as
//!   `RoomNotSynced` until the backlog is in, or delivery held until it is): the backlog room's
//!   wait passes [`READY_WITHIN`] while the fresh room's does not — claim 1 red on the backlog
//!   arm's own assertion, and the fresh arm stays green, which is the point;
//! - `--history older` fetching nothing (the demand answered with no page): bob's count stops at
//!   the live window — claim 2 red as `PRODUCT: … older page never arrived`;
//! - the consent release covering no history (`history_plan` returns nothing): the 1,500-post arm
//!   red with bob short of 1,500 once the pages are asked for.

// Two blocking-or-optional arms (decider, 2026-10-01: "Valid proofs block; rest optional"). The
// 160-post history BLOCKS: a newcomer reads every post exactly once and in order, the part below
// the live window on demand. The timing claim (one wait, fresh or behind) and the 1,500-post
// history are optional: CI only compiles them, and without `--features optional-proofs` a stand-in
// says each was not run (`support/optional_proof.rs`).
