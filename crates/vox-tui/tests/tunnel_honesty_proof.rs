//! **A tunnel tells the truth about how it ended**, proved by running the product
//! (PRD-001 R22, R23, R24; defects D6, D7 and D11).
//!
//! Every property here is about what an *application* sees on the far side of a tunnel —
//! a socket that succeeds, fails, resets or keeps working — so every one is measured with a
//! real TCP socket against real `vox` processes, and nothing reaches into `vox_core`:
//!
//! - **A forward survives its host restarting** (R24, D7). `vox forward` used to pin the
//!   one QUIC connection it started with, so once the host restarted every later connection
//!   was opened on a connection that went nowhere and the forward was dead while still
//!   bound. Here the host's `vox serve` is killed and the same room brought back by
//!   `vox daemon` on a **different port**, and the *same* forward must carry a new
//!   connection.
//!
//! ## Why it is `#[ignore]`d
//!
//! Production Argon2id on several profiles plus a real ADR-005 proof of work per test, and a
//! wait on QUIC's idle timeout in the restart proof. CI runs these in release with the other
//! real-parameter proofs.
